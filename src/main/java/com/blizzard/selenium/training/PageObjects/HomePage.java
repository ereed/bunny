 * 
 * Summary: Using this type of java class is very useful to breakdown clutter in
 * code. Within this java class, only objects are held here. In Selenium's case,
 * it will hold temporary values for elements which will be used by another
 * class. This makes it possible for the objects to be reused multiple times
 * from other classes. Less rewriting the code, the better.
